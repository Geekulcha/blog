The audience was then encouraged to take part in any one of the challenges at their own discretion with the aid of the experts present.</p><p></p><p>The top three challenges in summary</p><p><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> ”Yehla”, Presented by Tiyani Nghonyama from <a href=http://www.geekulcha.com>Geekulcha</a></p><p>The task here was to create a mobile app that will alert taxi users of their point of departure, to avoid missing stops and getting lost.</p><p><strong>Challenge 2</strong> : “Ajira”, Presented by Dr Jabu</p><p>Hackers were to design and develop a backend and client(s) app that would allow a micro employer to post jobs. The backend system should also be able to rate uWorkers after each submission.</p><p><strong>Challenge 3</strong> : School Library System, Presented by Jay from the African school of excellence.</p><p>The task entailed upgrading an already existing library system to keep track of books going in and out of the school’s library.</p><p>The rest of the challenges</p><p><strong>Challenge 4</strong> : <a href=https://twitter.com/RobohandSA>@RobohandSA</a>, Presented by Quentin Harley from House4Hack</p><p>Interested parties were to create a system that will be used by doctors to enter hand measurements of patients who lose their hands in fatalities and then use a 3D Printer to print the robot hand..</p><p><strong>Challenge 5:</strong> Medical stock out, Presented by Dr Jabu from UNISA</p><p>This system should be able to alert hospitals/ clinics of soon coming medication shortages.</p><p><strong>Challenge 6</strong> : Donate-My-Stuff, Presented by Ishmael Makitla from the CSIR</p><p>Attendees were presented with a task to create a web based application that will act as a mediator between donors and people in need. Donors should be able to make offers and view requests made by potential beneficiaries.</p><p></p><p>We were given about 36 hours (meaning NO SLEEP!) to code the solutions. Sounds fun right? Not only do students get the opportunity to platform their coding skills, but non-coders, like me, get to draw from fellow group members. For one, I was introduced to JSON for the first time (Side note: I feel I need to broadcast how good I turned out to be at it). Another interesting aspect of this event is getting to take part in uplifting, thought shifting conversations with like-minded people during “down time”. A great way to connect, gather inspiration and make friends that will yield good fruit in the future.</p><p></p><p><a href=http://www.geekulcha.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/RHoK-Group-Photo.jpg><img src=http://www.geekulcha.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/RHoK-Group-Photo.jpg alt="RHoK Group Photo"></a></p><p>Apart from all of the above, the idea of utilizing what you know to be a small part of something bigger than you to help and advance humanity is in excess of humbling. So, I’d like to urge all IT enthusiasts; students, employees and employers to look out for the next RHoK event and avail themselves. Be part of the revolution. Hack for humanity!</p><p>Lehlogonolo Sathekge</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/NoleyNols>@NoleyNols</a></p></article><footer><div class=footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-md-3 md-margin-bottom-40"><div class=headline><h2 class=heading-sm>About Us</h2></div><p class=margin-bottom-20>Geekulcha is where the young, talented, creative and ambitious IT minds meet to learn, share their knowledge, connect with industry leaders, get exposure and put their skills to work.</p></div><div class="col-md-6 md-margin-bottom-40"><div class=text-center style=margin-top:80px><ul class=social-icons><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/Geekulcha data-original-title=Facebook class="rounded-x social_facebook"></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/Geekulcha data-original-title=Twitter class="rounded-x social_twitter"></a></li><li><a href=https://plus.google.com/u/0/105852459159546202310/about data-original-title=Google+ class="rounded-x social_googleplus"></a></li><li><a href="http://geekulcha.wordpress.com/" data-original-title=Wordpress class="rounded-x social_wordpress"></a></li><li><a href=http://www.youtube.com/Geekulcha data-original-title=Youtube class="rounded-x social_youtube"></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="col-md-3 md-margin-bottom-40"><div class=headline><h2 class=heading-sm>Contact Us</h2></div><address class=md-margin-bottom-40>U8 Enterprise Building<br>The Innovation Hub<br>Presquor, 0087<br>Phone: 074 373 0639<br>E-mail: <a href=mailto:info@geekulcha.com class="">info@geekulcha.com</a></address></div></div></div></div><div class=copyright><div class=container><p class=text-center>2014 &copy;<a href=http://www.geekulcha.com>Geekulcha</a>.
