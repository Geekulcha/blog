We want you to get really close cause what I am about to demonstrate is a very subtle explanation of what is perhaps the very tip of Innovation on this continent.</p><p></p><p>Yes we do, a lot of events but today I’m delaying the inevitable with much gusto and heartfelt sincerity cause what we saw was not only mind blowing but also highly informative, innovation-intensive and proof on more than one level that what we have entitled as “the Corporates” are not only aware of human challenges but want to take part in developing and cultivating the necessary skills that can sustain this continents emerging markets and expand our global awareness through their experiences.</p><p><img src=http://www.geekulcha.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tech4africa-300x119.png alt=tech4africa> Presenting TechAfrica 2013, an annual event that’s said to be the premier mobile, web &amp; emerging technology conference, bringing global perspective to the African context. The event aims to introduce, inform and inspire attendees by focusing on topics ranging from mobile, tech-startups and other innovative tech to business approaches that can radically change a companies outlook on dealing with industry challenges. Tech4Africa was a torrent of much appreciated “food” for thought that not only enlightened many but broke some rather vital barriers when it comes to Technology as a business commodity and pitching a functional business strategy to people who understand the potential for your ambition and eventual growth, from the perspective of those who have had an experienced feel of what is technology in Africa as a global competitor.</p><p></p><p>On the 9th of October, the day began with a lot of expectations on our side. Some were anticipating mobile give-aways, others were thinking about the Nedbank Code Challenge running con-currently with the Event while others were just taken aback by the fact that we decided to move out of our comfort zones and approach some of those so called “Industry Prime time Programmers.” Much of the talks were about the philosophies on improving remedial business practices that are generally never considered, how pivoting a business can enhance it’s survival and overall gain and how technology can be used to better human life by not only applying to daily deficiencies but finding creative use around varying challenges in a world in need of a multitude of applicable solutions. Not to mention those who has a taste for alcohol, missed out on something of a free beer.</p><p></p><p>Day Two’s (10th of October) Event was filled with a lot of more meaningful and business refinement presentations, some more formal others really casual but most were not just chats with the intent of social networking. They were all focused on deriving much needed purpose-driven practices in daily business scenarios in areas like Teaching that can be the very lifeline to a business as it’s uncharted territory unravels and is often the very risk factor required for success. Two of our Geeks had the privilege of gracing the stage, and making a contribution for us and themselves. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/diraul?fref=ts">Raul Diffouo</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tiyani.w.nghonyama?fref=ts">Tiyani Nghonyama</a> both were given the chance to contribute on the Day and they made us very proud to be called “Geeks.” Raul’s presentation was focused on his more recent project that included an HTML Website and a native App. Tiyani’s Presentation was a challenge to the youth to wake up and make hey while the sun still shines, he enforced his point by demonstrating what he has been been developing which is an app that saves electricity.</p><p></p><p>Both these Engineers-in-training are hard at work at proving their presence was not one that was to occur once in a lifetime. Thank you kindly to Gareth Knight(host) and Zinnia Peens(hostess) who were very welcoming and quite ardent about some of us being present in all the talks, we do mean Gareth when we say ardent. Overall though it was a day for Technology to be celebrated and not to mention Networking with the relevant individuals, and also spending time absorbing, applying and refining the intent to command and conquer androids!! <img src=http://www.geekulcha.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/T4A-300x283.jpg alt=T4A></p></article><footer><div class=footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-md-3 md-margin-bottom-40"><div class=headline><h2 class=heading-sm>About Us</h2></div><p class=margin-bottom-20>Geekulcha is where the young, talented, creative and ambitious IT minds meet to learn, share their knowledge, connect with industry leaders, get exposure and put their skills to work.</p></div><div class="col-md-6 md-margin-bottom-40"><div class=text-center style=margin-top:80px><ul class=social-icons><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/Geekulcha data-original-title=Facebook class="rounded-x social_facebook"></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/Geekulcha data-original-title=Twitter class="rounded-x social_twitter"></a></li><li><a href=https://plus.google.com/u/0/105852459159546202310/about data-original-title=Google+ class="rounded-x social_googleplus"></a></li><li><a href="http://geekulcha.wordpress.com/" data-original-title=Wordpress class="rounded-x social_wordpress"></a></li><li><a href=http://www.youtube.com/Geekulcha data-original-title=Youtube class="rounded-x social_youtube"></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="col-md-3 md-margin-bottom-40"><div class=headline><h2 class=heading-sm>Contact Us</h2></div><address class=md-margin-bottom-40>U8 Enterprise Building<br>The Innovation Hub<br>Presquor, 0087<br>Phone: 074 373 0639<br>E-mail: <a href=mailto:info@geekulcha.com class="">info@geekulcha.com</a></address></div></div></div></div><div class=copyright><div class=container><p class=text-center>2014 &copy;<a href=http://www.geekulcha.com>Geekulcha</a>.
