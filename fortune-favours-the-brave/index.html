Sucking you dry of all the little motivation and desire left in you to push on. Leaving you depressed, hopeless and ready to give up. Question is what do you intend to do about it?</p><p>Depressing I know, that’s the reality many are facing, including myself. It’s not the best of feelings because we humans don’t like feeling useless and hopeless. Yet most of us feel that way which affects our productivity, our health and relationships with family, friends, etc. If you are reading this and can relate to it, I have news for you. It’s a war zone out there and giving up is just not an option if you really want something badly</p><p><em>“Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.”</em> ― <a href=http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4918776.Seneca>Seneca</a></p><p>Having massive dreams, ambitions and goals sucks big time when something seems to stand in the way of realizing them. Life deals you a horrible hand every time you make a bold step forward which is a dreadful feeling because you have invested so much in it, inevitably resulting with one crushing their own dreams and ambitions because they have lost hope. However how difficult it gets, life without hope isn’t worth living. It’s just like a floating balloon with no direction. It will eventually land at a wrong place and burst.</p><p><em>“The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain.” __- Dolly Parton</em></p><p>As I type this I have a heavy heart for those giving up on life and their dreams, hoping that someone will read this and get a boost to carry on fighting. <em>Aluta Continua</em>! I don’t believe we are on this earth just to eat, sleep, chat, dream, wish, waste air, eat and sleep. We should refuse to believe that! People out there are making it, they are hustling and are reaching their goals. They become so successful that once a specific goal is achieved it gives birth to another goal. It’s not that they are better it’s just that their will to fight is stronger. Though we admire them we shouldn’t define our success according to others. Do you and do you as best as possible.</p><p><em>“Being challenged in life is inevitable, being defeated is optional.”__ ― <a href=http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/443146.Roger_Crawford>Roger Crawford</a></em></p><p>Doors will close on you; you will be faced with endless rejections and will fail on plenty of accusations. I know I have. Just laugh it off, pick yourself up, dust your failures off and carry on pursuing your dreams whatever they may be. Eventually life will reward you for your effects. Fortune and success really favours the brave. It rewards them for their efforts. It admires their characters. Work hard, play hard. Enjoy life to the fullest, embrace its challenges.</p><p><em>“Don’t give up! It’s not over. The universe is balanced.
