One of the greatest challenges facing our beloved country is the rate of unemployment. Let's face it,it's not going to end anytime soon. There is a growing debate on whether the government is doing enough to create jobs for the youth and also for the general public. Another challenge that comes to mind, even though some see it as an excuse by big corporates,is that we are in an economic crisis and instead companies are letting people go than hiring them.  As a young South African I must admit that's its a mission to get a job, even a simple internship and I have seen a lot of my friends get frustrated and close to giving up because there just seems to be no opportunities for them.Take a simple government internship post where they are looking for just 3 people yet over a thousand have applied.  It's easy to sit and blame the government and the huge corporates.Okay maybe they can and should do just a little bit extra but question is what are you the individual doing to better your own life?  I'm a huge admirer of street vendors and those standing on the roads selling things in the blazing heat all day.Yes,maybe that's not the route I would take but I like how they refuse to sit at home and do nothing with their lives while constantly complaining about what they lack.Instead they wake up and go hustle hard **Release your potential** _“This is a time for bold measures. This is the country, and you are the generation.”_ --  [Bono](http://www.betterworldheroes.com/bono.htm) Most of the guys doing IT in tertiary have amazing skills in developing systems,apps and almost anything that is required.Sometimes I wish I had the skills they have.Yet they sit at home and majority will never take the bold step and do something for themselves with their skills because they have a mentality that the only way to make money is to have a boss.What if no boss decides to hire you? **We lack **** Entrepreneurs**_"The young do not know enough to be prudent, and therefore they attempt the impossible, and achieve it, generation after generation._ " --  [Pearl S. Buck](http://www.betterworldheroes.com/buck.htm)  I have taken lots of risk with the little money got my hands on and 6/10 times the risk paid of.I am not yet where I want to be but I believe I have a business mentality and I will keep digging my gold mine.I know the challenges that face one in starting something with financial backing being one of them but that alone shouldn't stop you as long as you believe in your idea  A lot of countries out do us in a lot of areas but one that stands out is in the entrepreneur department. A lot of people,especially young guys are making a killing financially all over the world especially in America and it's not that they have a strong financial muscle but because they are constantly looking for ideas,opportunities and are not afraid of taking the risk.  Lots of names spring to mind when I think of guys who made it from nothing to being filthy rich.One of my favourite local guys is Dj Sbu. Those who know Sbu will tell you he started from nothing but is now making it big as a musician,radio dj and has now ventured into the clothing industry all because he took a risk,believed in himself and worked his pants off  So to those still looking for jobs your time will come if you remain patient and have faith.Just don't sit around doing nothing with your life and becoming a human TV guide while waiting for companies to call you or opportunities dropping from the sky. Go out there and volunteer, develop a new skill, polish your current skill, hustle hard, take a chance and create a need where there is a lack _“There is no obstacle in the path of young people who are poor or members of minority groups that hard work and preparation cannot cure.” _ --  [Barbara Jordan](http://www.betterworldheroes.com/jordan-barbara.htm)
